# criminal-intent-app
The Criminal Intent app I made as part of the secure mobile application development module at uni.

This is an Android app made with Java in Android Studio where users can:
- Log crimes, including what the crime is, when it was reported, who the suspect is with a photo.
- Send reports to contacts 
- Call a contact 

This also serves as a playground for trying out various things with Java development!
